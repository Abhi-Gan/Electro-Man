# Electro-Man
Single/Multiplayer sidescroller game written in Java


This is a sidescroller game I made from scratch in Java using the swing and awt libraries.
The game can be played by 1 to 4 players. The goal is to survive as long as possible by staying on screen as the screen moves to the right, avoiding obstacles that come up along the way. Each player has 2 buttons for control. The first button allows them to switch their direction of acceleration and the second allows them to shoot projectiles at other players. 


Features to observe:
* Collision detection
* Customizable color and name for characters 
* Obstacles including tracking missiles, normal missiles, walls, and projectiles players can launch at each other
* Power-Ups such as portals and speed boosters
* Animations for explosions, character movement, etc. to enhance game quality
